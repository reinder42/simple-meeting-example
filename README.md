Students are invited to take a
look at the `src/test/java` for
some examples on unit testing.

## To do
This example project, although useful,
is incomplete.

* Use GitHub Actions
* Add tests for controllers
* Show more examples of using test doubles
* Add Spring system tests
* Add more internal integration tests
* Register coverage using maven (CoCoMe)
* Display coverage on README
